# Planned Integration Tests

This document outlines the integration tests that should be implemented for AssembleJS components that require more complex testing scenarios involving multiple modules or external dependencies.

## Logger Utils Integration Tests

The `logger.utils.ts` module requires integration tests due to its complex interactions with environment variables, console output, and global formatter/writer configuration.

### Proposed Integration Tests for Logger Utils

1. **Environment Variable-Based Configuration**

   - Test different log level configurations via environment variables
   - Verify class-specific log level overrides work correctly
   - Test behavior when environment variables change during runtime

2. **Logger Writer Configuration**

   - Test custom logger writer implementation
   - Verify all log methods correctly use the configured writer
   - Test behavior when writer is reconfigured mid-execution

3. **Formatter Configuration**

   - Test custom formatter implementations
   - Verify formatting applies correctly to different log levels
   - Test behavior with stylized log messages

4. **Log Level Filtering**
   - Test that messages are correctly filtered based on configured log level
   - Verify hierarchical filtering (e.g., INFO level includes WARN and ERROR)
   - Test edge cases like OFF and ALL configurations

## Component/Blueprint Integration Tests

The component rendering system requires integration tests to verify the correct interaction between BlueprintController, Component rendering, and event system.

### Proposed Integration Tests for Component System

1. **Component Lifecycle**

   - Test correct initialization and lifecycle hooks execution
   - Verify cleanup and garbage collection
   - Test nested component hierarchies

2. **Event Communication**

   - Test event propagation between components
   - Verify event bubbling and capturing behavior
   - Test cross-blueprint event communication

3. **Server-Side Rendering**

   - Test hydration of server-rendered components
   - Verify state preservation during SSR
   - Test error handling during rendering

4. **Blueprint Composition**
   - Test nested blueprint rendering
   - Verify parameter passing between blueprints
   - Test dynamic blueprint loading

## HTTP/API Integration Tests

The HTTP and API utilities require integration tests to verify correct behavior with actual HTTP interactions.

### Proposed Integration Tests for HTTP Utils

1. **Error Handling**

   - Test HTTP error conversion to AssembleJS errors
   - Verify status code mapping
   - Test error response formatting

2. **Request Processing**

   - Test request parameter extraction
   - Verify content-type handling
   - Test request validation middleware

3. **Response Generation**
   - Test response formatting
   - Verify content negotiation
   - Test streaming responses

## Factory Integration Tests

The factory system requires integration tests to verify correct behavior with actual data transformation operations.

### Proposed Integration Tests for Factory System

1. **Factory Registration**

   - Test factory registration in the blueprint server
   - Verify factory discovery and instantiation
   - Test factory dependency injection

2. **Factory Execution**

   - Test factory data transformation
   - Verify caching behavior
   - Test error handling during factory execution

3. **Factory Composition**
   - Test chaining multiple factories
   - Verify data flow between factories
   - Test conditional factory execution

## Generator End-to-End Tests

The generator functionality requires end-to-end tests to verify the correct creation and functioning of components.

### Proposed End-to-End Tests for Generator

1. **Project Generation**

   - Test creating a new project with different options
   - Verify all expected files are created with correct content
   - Test project can be built and served successfully
   - Validate package.json has correct dependencies and scripts

2. **Component Generation**

   - Test creating components with different templating options (ejs, html, tsx, md)
   - Verify the component structure is created correctly
   - Test component can be rendered and functions in a running application
   - Validate client-server communication works for generated components

3. **Blueprint Generation**

   - Test creating blueprints with different view options
   - Verify the blueprint structure is created correctly
   - Test blueprint can be navigated to in a running application
   - Validate URL routing to blueprints works correctly

4. **Controller/Service/Factory Generation**

   - Test creating controllers, services, and factories
   - Verify the files are created with correct content
   - Test these components function correctly when used in application
   - Validate dependency injection and lifecycle hooks

5. **CLI Command Validation**

   - Test error handling for invalid command arguments
   - Verify helpful error messages for missing parameters
   - Test shorthand commands function as expected
   - Validate command aliases work correctly

6. **Server Integration Testing**

   - Start generated application server
   - Send HTTP requests to verify component rendering
   - Test API endpoints from controllers
   - Validate error handling and status codes

7. **File System Operations**
   - Verify correct file permissions are set
   - Test generation in various directory structures
   - Validate behavior when files already exist
   - Test generation of nested components

## Implementation Strategy

These integration tests should be implemented as a separate test suite that can be run independently from unit tests. They may require:

1. A mock server environment
2. Test-specific configuration
3. Cleanup procedures to reset state between tests
4. Fixtures for component and blueprint definitions
5. Custom test reporters for analyzing integration behavior

Because integration tests may have side effects and could be slower than unit tests, they should be run separately from the regular fast unit test suite, possibly as part of a pre-release verification process.

## Additional Testing Strategies

1. **Performance Testing**

   - Measure rendering performance of components
   - Test scaling with large numbers of components
   - Benchmark server response times under load

2. **Snapshot Testing**

   - Create snapshots of rendered components for regression testing
   - Verify visual consistency across different environments
   - Test component appearance with different parameters

3. **Visual Regression Testing**

   - Capture screenshots of rendered components
   - Compare visual appearance across browser environments
   - Detect unexpected UI changes

4. **Accessibility Testing**

   - Test component accessibility compliance
   - Verify keyboard navigation works correctly
   - Test screen reader compatibility

5. **Browser Compatibility Testing**
   - Test components in different browsers and versions
   - Verify consistent behavior across platforms
   - Test polyfill effectiveness for older browsers
