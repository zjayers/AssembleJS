# A.R.L.O. Workflow

The A.R.L.O. (AssembleJS Repository Logic Orchestrator) workflow defines how tasks are processed from submission to completion. This document outlines the standard workflow and explains how tasks move through the system.

## Workflow Overview

The A.R.L.O. workflow follows these main phases:

1. **Task Submission** - Developer submits a task request
2. **Admin Analysis** - Initial evaluation of the request
3. **Planning** - Configuration agent creates an execution plan
4. **Execution** - Developer agent implements necessary changes
5. **Validation** - Quality assurance and testing
6. **Git Operations** - Repository management and PR creation

## Detailed Workflow

### 1. Task Submission

The workflow begins when a developer submits a task through the web interface:

```
Developer → Task Form → Task Storage
```

During submission, developers provide:
- Detailed task description
- Optional context or requirements
- Any specific constraints or preferences

### 2. Admin Analysis

The Admin agent evaluates the task:

```
Admin Agent → Task Analysis → Requirements Assessment
```

During analysis:
- Task scope is determined
- Required specialists are identified
- Initial approach is formulated
- Task complexity is evaluated

### 3. Planning

The Config agent creates an execution plan:

```
Config Agent → Planning → Execution Strategy
```

The plan includes:
- Step-by-step implementation approach
- Resource requirements
- Technical specifications
- Integration considerations

### 4. Execution

The Developer agent implements the solution:

```
Developer Agent → Implementation → Code Changes
```

Key execution activities:
- Code development
- Integration with existing systems
- Documentation updates
- Functionality verification

### 5. Validation

The Validator agent performs quality assurance:

```
Validator Agent → Testing → Quality Verification
```

Validation includes:
- Functional testing
- Performance evaluation
- Adherence to requirements
- Code quality checks

### 6. Git Operations

The Git agent handles repository changes:

```
Git Agent → Repository Management → Pull Request
```

Git operations include:
- Code commits
- Branch management
- Pull request creation
- Repository organization

## Task Pipeline Visualization

The task pipeline is visualized in the web interface, showing the progression of a task through each stage:

```
┌───────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐
│     Admin     │     │    Planning   │     │   Execution   │
│    Analysis   │────▶│    (Config)   │────▶│  (Developer)  │
└───────────────┘     └───────────────┘     └───────────────┘
        │                                           │
        │                                           ▼
┌───────▼───────┐     ┌───────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐
│      Task     │     │ Git Operations│     │   Validation  │
│   Submission  │     │    (Git)      │◀────│  (Validator)  │
└───────────────┘     └───────────────┘     └───────────────┘
```

## Real-time Updates

Throughout the workflow process, A.R.L.O. provides:

- Real-time status updates in the UI
- Detailed logs of each step
- Agent-specific knowledge contributions
- Progress indicators for each phase

## Task Storage and History

All tasks are stored in the file system:

- Individual JSON files per task
- Complete task history preserved
- Searchable through the Knowledge Base
- Accessible through the Tasks API

## Communication Between Agents

Agents communicate by:

- Adding knowledge to their collections
- Reading from other agents' collections
- Updating the shared task state
- Adding logs to the task history

## Technical Implementation

The workflow is implemented through:

- File-based JSON storage
- RESTful API endpoints
- Event-driven updates
- Semantic knowledge storage
- Task pipeline simulation

## Workflow Monitoring

Developers can monitor task progress through:

- The A.R.L.O. web dashboard
- Task details view
- Pipeline visualization
- Logs and status updates

## Best Practices

To ensure smooth A.R.L.O. workflows:

1. **Provide clear task descriptions** with all relevant details
2. **Monitor the task pipeline** for progress
3. **Review agent contributions** in the knowledge base
4. **Use the feedback mechanism** to improve future tasks
5. **Reference existing knowledge** when appropriate

## Next Steps
