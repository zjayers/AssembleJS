# Introduction to A.R.L.O.

A.R.L.O. (AssembleJS Repository Logic Orchestrator) is an advanced AI agent system designed to maintain, extend, and provide expert knowledge about the AssembleJS framework. A.R.L.O. functions both as an internal development team for the AssembleJS framework and as a potential user-facing assistant.

## What is A.R.L.O.?

A.R.L.O. is a collective of specialized AI agents, each responsible for a specific aspect of the AssembleJS ecosystem. These agents work together to provide comprehensive assistance with framework development, code refinement, project architecture, and more.

A.R.L.O. serves as the AI development team behind AssembleJS, helping the framework evolve by:

- **Implementing features** with minimal mistakes and high code quality
- **Fixing bugs** using expert insight into AssembleJS internals
- **Refactoring code** according to best practices
- **Generating boilerplate** while following established patterns
- **Documenting functionality** with consistency and clarity

## Key Benefits of A.R.L.O.

A.R.L.O. sets itself apart from generic AI assistants through its:

- **Deep Specialization**: Each agent has in-depth knowledge of a specific part of the AssembleJS framework
- **Collective Intelligence**: Agents collaborate to solve complex problems
- **Framework-Aware**: Understands AssembleJS internals, patterns, and best practices
- **Consistent Output**: Produces code that adheres to established conventions
- **Ongoing Development**: Learns and adapts as the framework evolves

## System Architecture

A.R.L.O. is built with a modular architecture residing in the `.arlo` directory:

- **Web Interface**: Browser-based UI for interaction and task management
- **RESTful API**: Clean endpoints for all system operations
- **File-based Storage**: JSON files for persistent knowledge and tasks
- **Agent System**: Specialized AI agents with domain expertise
- **Express Server**: Lightweight Node.js server for the web interface

## The A.R.L.O. Team

A.R.L.O. consists of 16 specialist agents, each with a distinct role:

1. **Admin** - Project coordinator and workflow orchestrator - communicates directly with supervisor
2. **Analyzer** - Performance optimization specialist for `/src/analyzer/`
3. **ARLO** - Self-maintenance and ARLO system enhancement specialist
4. **Browser** - Frontend architecture expert for `/src/browser/`
5. **Bundler** - Build system specialist for `/src/bundler/`
6. **Config** - Configuration and system settings expert
7. **Developer** - Development tooling expert for `/src/developer/`
8. **Generator** - Code scaffolding specialist for `/src/generator/`
9. **Git** - Repository management, PR creation, and version control expert
10. **Pipeline** - GitHub Actions workflow and CI/CD pipeline manager
11. **Docs** - Documentation and knowledge management specialist
12. **Server** - Backend architecture expert for `/src/server/`
13. **Testbed** - Testbed project management specialist for `/testbed/`
14. **Types** - Type system design specialist for `/src/types/`
15. **Utils** - Utility function expert for `/src/utils/`
16. **Validator** - Quality assurance and testing specialist
17. **Version** - Package versioning and dependency management expert

## Internal Workflow

When a new task is submitted to A.R.L.O., it follows this workflow:

1. Request task is submitted to Admin via the interface
2. Admin interviews supervisor for clarification and requirements
3. Admin consults with specialist agents to develop execution plan
4. Admin presents execution plan to supervisor for approval
5. Upon approval, Admin coordinates specialist team members
6. Admin creates feature branch via Git agent
7. Specialist agents implement changes and provide code recommendations
8. Git agent handles commits with semantic messages
9. Validator ensures all changes work together (build, lint, tests)
10. Version updates package versions if needed
11. Testbed verifies changes in testbed projects if applicable
12. Pipeline verifies CI/CD workflow configurations are updated if needed
13. Git agent creates a well-formatted PR and pushes to GitHub
14. Admin reports "All changes completed" with PR link for review to supervisor

## Knowledge Management System

A.R.L.O.'s knowledge is organized in collections:

- Each agent has a dedicated knowledge collection (agent_[Name])
- Collections are stored as JSON files in data/collections/
- Tasks are stored individually in data/tasks/ with JSON format
- Simple text-based semantic search implementation
- RESTful API for knowledge retrieval and storage
- Agent "brain" capabilities for cross-agent collaboration

## The A.R.L.O. Web Interface

A.R.L.O. includes a comprehensive web interface for interacting with the system:

- **Task Dashboard**: Visual management of current tasks and workflows
- **Agent Interface**: Direct interaction with specialist agents
- **Knowledge Browser**: Search and exploration of the knowledge base
- **Settings Panel**: System configuration and preferences
- **Reports View**: Detailed analytics and system performance

## Future User-Facing Mode

A.R.L.O. is designed to eventually serve as a user-facing expert on AssembleJS:

1. **Knowledge Infrastructure**
   - Framework documentation index
   - Code pattern recognition
   - Usage examples and best practices

2. **Assistant Features**
   - CLI for framework questions
   - Code snippet generation
   - Troubleshooting assistance

3. **Implementation Path**
   - Initial focus on internal development assistance
   - Gradual transition to user-facing capabilities
   - Knowledge continuously refined through development work

## When to Use A.R.L.O.

A.R.L.O. is particularly valuable for the AssembleJS framework when:

- Building new features for the AssembleJS framework
- Refactoring existing code to improve performance or maintainability
- Troubleshooting complex bugs or integration issues
- Creating consistent documentation across the project
- Setting up proper testing and validation workflows
- Implementing best practices across the codebase

## Accessing A.R.L.O.

Currently, A.R.L.O. is primarily an internal development system for the AssembleJS team. To learn more about how A.R.L.O. works and its internal architecture, see the [A.R.L.O. Architecture](arlo/architecture) guide.
