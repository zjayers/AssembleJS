# Getting Started with A.R.L.O.

This guide will help you set up and begin using A.R.L.O. (AssembleJS Repository Logic Orchestrator), an advanced AI agent system designed for AssembleJS framework development and maintenance. A.R.L.O.'s team of specialized agents work together to analyze, plan, and implement tasks across the codebase.

## System Overview

A.R.L.O. is an internal development system for the AssembleJS framework that uses:

- A team of 16+ specialized AI agents with domain-specific knowledge
- A web interface for task submission and monitoring
- File-based JSON storage for knowledge and tasks
- A structured workflow with approval gates
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

## Prerequisites

Before setting up A.R.L.O., ensure you have:

- A local clone of the AssembleJS repository
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git credentials (for creating PRs if enabled)

## Installation

A.R.L.O. is integrated into the AssembleJS repository in the `.arlo` directory:

1. Navigate to your AssembleJS repository root:

```bash
cd path/to/your/assemblejs/repo
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
cd .arlo
npm install
```

3. Start the A.R.L.O. server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the A.R.L.O. server on http://localhost:3030 by default.

## Accessing the A.R.L.O. Interface

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3030
```

The interface provides several key sections:

- **Dashboard**: Overview of all current tasks and system health
- **Tasks**: Submit and monitor tasks with detailed progress tracking
- **Agents**: View agent profiles, expertise, and knowledge collections
- **Knowledge Base**: Search across all agent knowledge
- **Settings**: Configure system parameters and agent behavior

## Submitting Your First Task

To submit a task to A.R.L.O.:

1. Click the "New Task" button on the Dashboard or Tasks page
2. Enter a detailed task description, for example:
   ```
   Implement caching for blueprint renderer to improve performance
   ```
3. Select priority level (optional)
4. Add any relevant tags or context
5. Click "Submit Task"

## Task Execution Process

Your task will progress through these stages:

1. **Submitted**: Task is created and queued for processing
2. **Analyzing**: Admin agent analyzes the task requirements
   - Reviews the task description
   - Identifies required specialist agents
   - Evaluates complexity and approach
   - Asks clarifying questions if needed

3. **Planning**: A detailed execution plan is created
   - Step-by-step implementation approach
   - Required resources and dependencies
   - Team of specialist agents assigned
   - Approval request sent to supervisor

4. **Executing**: After plan approval, implementation begins
   - Git agent creates a feature branch
   - Specialist agents implement changes
   - Progress is logged in detail
   - Code changes are tracked

5. **Validating**: Changes undergo quality assessment
   - Tests are run and verified
   - Code quality is evaluated
   - Performance is measured
   - Documentation is updated

6. **Completed**: Task is finalized with pull request
   - Git agent creates PR with changes
   - PR link is provided for review
   - Task details are archived

You can monitor the live progress of your task on the Task Detail page, including:
- Current status and completion percentage
- Agent activity log with timestamps
- Detailed progress visualization
- File changes and test results

## Working with Agent Knowledge

A.R.L.O. maintains knowledge collections for each specialist agent:

- **Browser Agent**: Frontend architecture, client-side rendering, component design
- **Server Agent**: Backend architecture, API design, server-side rendering
- **Utils Agent**: Utility functions, common patterns, reusable operations
- **Types Agent**: Type definitions, interface design, API typing

You can:
- Browse knowledge collections in the Knowledge Base
- Search across all collections
- View code examples and patterns
- See agent decision-making processes

## Using the API

A.R.L.O. provides a comprehensive RESTful API:

### Collections API

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/collections` | GET | Get all collections |
| `/api/collections/:name` | GET | Get a specific collection |
| `/api/collections/:name/documents` | GET | Get documents in collection |
| `/api/collections/:name/query` | POST | Query a collection |

### Agent API

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/agent` | GET | Get all agents |
| `/api/agent/:name` | GET | Get a specific agent |
| `/api/agent/:name/knowledge` | GET | Get agent knowledge |
| `/api/agent/:name/query` | POST | Query agent knowledge |

### Tasks API

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/tasks` | GET | Get all tasks |
| `/api/tasks/:id` | GET | Get a specific task |
| `/api/tasks` | POST | Create a new task |
| `/api/tasks/:id/execute` | POST | Execute a task |

## Best Practices

To get the most out of A.R.L.O.:

1. **Be specific and detailed** in your task descriptions
2. **Provide clear context** about affected components
3. **Respond promptly** to clarification questions
4. **Review execution plans** carefully before approval
5. **Check implementation details** during execution
6. **Test changes thoroughly** after completion

## A.R.L.O. Agent Team

A.R.L.O.'s specialized agents include:

| Agent | Expertise Area | Code Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| Admin | Coordination | Project-wide coordination |
| Analyzer | Performance | `/src/analyzer/` |
| Browser | Frontend | `/src/browser/` |
| Bundler | Build System | `/src/bundler/` |
| Server | Backend | `/src/server/` |
| Types | Type System | `/src/types/` |
| Utils | Utilities | `/src/utils/` |
| Git | Version Control | Repository management |

Each agent has specialized knowledge of their domain and contributes to collaborative task execution.
