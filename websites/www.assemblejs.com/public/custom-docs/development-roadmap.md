- **Universal Component Model** - Evolve towards a truly universal component model

### Community and Ecosystem

- **Component Marketplace** - Build a marketplace for sharing and distributing components
- **Blueprint Templates** - Create a repository of blueprint templates for common use cases
- **Community-Driven Extensions** - Foster development of community extensions and plugins

## Experimental Features

These features are currently in research and experimental phases:

- **Time-Travel Debugging** - Record and replay application states for debugging
- **AI-Generated Components** - Use machine learning to generate component code from descriptions
- **Native 3D Rendering** - Integrate with WebGPU for high-performance 3D rendering
- **Cross-Device Experiences** - Build systems for coordinating experiences across multiple devices

## Contributing to the Roadmap

The AssembleJS roadmap is influenced by community feedback and real-world usage. You can contribute to the direction of AssembleJS by:

1. **Providing Feedback** - Share your experiences using AssembleJS
2. **Submitting Feature Requests** - Propose new features through GitHub issues
3. **Participating in RFC Discussions** - Contribute to Request for Comments discussions
4. **Contributing Code** - Implement features or fixes aligned with the roadmap

## Release Cadence

AssembleJS follows a predictable release schedule:

- **Patch Releases** - Weekly (bug fixes and minor improvements)
- **Minor Releases** - Monthly (new features, non-breaking changes)
- **Major Releases** - Quarterly (potentially breaking changes, major features)

## Versioning Policy

AssembleJS follows semantic versioning:

- **Patch Version** (1.0.x) - Bug fixes and minor improvements
- **Minor Version** (1.x.0) - New features in a backward-compatible manner
- **Major Version** (x.0.0) - Breaking changes with migration paths

## Release Channels

AssembleJS provides multiple release channels:

- **Stable** - Thoroughly tested, production-ready releases
- **Beta** - Feature-complete releases undergoing final testing
- **Canary** - Bleeding-edge releases with experimental features

## Legacy Support Policy

AssembleJS provides the following support for older versions:

- **Current Major Version** - Full support with regular updates
- **Previous Major Version** - Critical bug fixes and security patches for 12 months
- **Older Versions** - Security patches only for 6 months after the release of a new major version
